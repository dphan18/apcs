We use the term ”supermathematics” to encompass all the various extensions of
Alice Roger’s original work on G∞ supermanifolds. Background on how numbers,
functions, linear algebra, matrix calculations, real analysis, complex analysis, manifold
theory and Lie theory generalize to the context of supermathematics is provided.
We use countably many Grassmann generators so this work is within the realm of
infinite dimensional Banach space theory.
We find that Lie’s Third Theorem holds for G∞ super Lie groups. We also prove
that the exponential mapping and other standard constructions in Lie theory apply
equally well in the G∞ setting. Portions of this work are similar to existing research,
but our proofs are distinct and we have focused on the G∞ category with infinitely
many Grassmann generators. Other workers typically either use finitely many Grassmann
generators or focus attention to the superanalytic category.
We provide a supersmooth principle fiber bundle framework for super gauge theory.
Special sections are constructed and provide pure gauge solutions on zero curvature
submanifolds. Quotient spaces and bundles are used to implement certain
physical constraints. We apply these general geometric constructions to recover the
superfield transformation laws of N = 1 super Yang-Mills theory.
We develop a gauged Wess-Zumino model in noncommutative Minkowski superspace.
This is a natural extension of the work of Carlson and Nazaryan, who extended
N = 1/2 supersymmetry over deformed Euclidean superspace to Minkowski superspace.
Noncommutativity is implemented by replacing products with star products.
As in the N = 1/2 theory, a reparameterization of the gauge parameter, vector superfield
and chiral superfield are necessary to write standard C-independent gauge
theory. However, our choice of parametrization differs from that used in the N = 1/2
supersymmetry, which leads to some unexpected new terms.
